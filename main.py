"""
This is the main class for the ToDo list program
The purpose of this program is a simple menu based to do list
to better keep track of taks with differing recurrencies and steps involved

Since my job does not generally involve deliverables, I want to make sure I am
keeping track of projects so they don't lie neglected.

Improvements I'd like to make as of now:
- add to git
- add more date/deadline support
- do some string or text formatting to make it look better
- add a gui so it doesn't look so stupid!
- scale it up and out somehow

Think about recreating in Access w/ forms for practice.
I feel like Access still looks eh, but maybe not.
